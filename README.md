### Crop Image Classification
This project involves using pretrained models like VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50 to classify images of crops. The dataset used contains images of 5 different classes of crops(rice, Jute, Wheat, Sugarcane and maize). The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aman2000jaiswal/agriculture-crop-images). The pretrained models are used to classify the images into one of the 5 classes. The models are able to classify the images with an average accuracy of 80%.

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to train deep learning models on large datasets. The models used in this project are pretrained on the ImageNet dataset which contains images of 1000 classes. The models are then fine-tuned on the crop dataset to classify the images into one of the 5 classes.

### Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the accuracy metric. The accuracy is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions. The models are able to classify the images with an average accuracy of 80%.

### Conclusion
The pretrained models are able to classify the images of crops with an average accuracy of 80%. The models can be further improved by fine-tuning the hyperparameters and using more advanced techniques like data augmentation and ensembling. The models can be used to classify images of crops in real-time and help farmers in identifying the crops in their fields.
